*Adopted April 30 2019*

This charter (the “Charter”) sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Urban Computing Foundation, which has been established as Urban Computing Foundation a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”).  LF Projects, LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All Contributors to the Project must comply with the terms of this Charter. 

#### 1. Mission and Scope of the Project ####
- (a)The mission of the Project is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of open source urban computing and a surrounding ecosystem.

- (b)The scope of the Project includes software development under an OSI-approved open source license supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source software project. 

#### 2. Technical Advisory Council #### 
- (a) The role of the Technical Advisory Council ("TAC") is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the technical open source, standards and/or specification projects in the area of urban computing (each such a "Technical Project").  Technical governance, including provisions concerning intellectual property policy, will be as set forth in the governance documents for each such Technical Project.

- (b) The TAC will be responsible for:
    - (i) accepting and approving open source, open data, or open specification projects as Technical Projects;
    - (ii) coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an overall technical vision for the community;
    - (iii) creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes;
    - (iv) creating sub-committees or working groups (e.g. policy working group) to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;
    - (v) discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; 
    - (vi) coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project with the LF Projects Manager or their designee;
    - (vii) appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities; and
    - (viii) electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings.

- (d) TAC meetings are intended to be open to the public. Decisions will be made by consensus where possible, and by simple majority vote where required.
