Map3 Network

# project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)

### What it is 
Map3 is a decentralized map service network that aims to make map services 10X more robust, open and efficient. 
- Decentralized p2p network for maps
- Rich community map layers
- Compatible with existing map technologies
- Privacy and trust protocol

### Why it is valuable
The "One Free Map" vision:
- **10x Robustness: free from control**; no central control or censorship. centralized map service has become a system risk to not just individual users but also entities using map as a technical construct. A community-hosted p2p network of nodes provide a truly robust map infrastructure that is impossible to shutdown. In other words, it make the map services "future proof".
- **10x Openness: free to participate**; it is a permission-less network. All resources (e.g. network infrastructure and map contents) are provided by the community and all values are shared by the community. It encourages data-sharing from different stake-holders to open up their spatial dataset. This is expected to facilitate cross-field innovations. 
- **10x Efficiency: free base map**; reasonable use of base map service is free of charge. This is possible thanks to the community donated resources. For higher SLA or proprietary map contents may subject to cost according to the policy configured by the owner. Map services are mostly about distributing small files and performing simple computations. There is a huge room to restructure the way we host and consume map services.

### Origin and History
The name Map3 refers to the 3rd generation of maps and also the map for the Web3 movements. Map has evolved substantially over the last two decades, broadly along the line of **map data** and **map service**. Here we discuss different map versions primarily based on the dominant paradigm of these two dimensions. 
- Map 1.0, Private Map: **Map data** produced by professional surveyors with purpose-built equipments. **Map services** are majorly hosted by some very big companies.
- Map 2.0, Open Map: **Map data** produced by global communities. Examples include OSM and other open geospatial dataset. There are many open source map systems and protocols released by companies like Mapbox and Mapzen. Some startup open map companies provide their **map service** based on open map data but the majority market is still dominated by the big companies. 
- Map 3.0, Consensus Map: A decentralized map network fully built, shared and governed by the communities. Map3 does not concern with how **map data** are generated but instead with how **map data** are shared and the corresponding values are transferred. **Map service** will be provided in p2p manner by the pervasive and powerful edge devices. It will be the community to provide the resources, share the derived value and govern the technological transition of the Map3 network.

# statement on alignment with Foundation charter's mission
The foundation charter's mission

“The mission of the Project is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of open source urban computing and a surrounding ecosystem.”

In addition to the aforementioned merits, Map3 has the potential to become an essential substrate of urban computing for its:
- robustness: Essential for urban computing service continuity, an enabling factor for continuous innovation and cross-industry collaboration. Map3 also improves the service reachability even in very underdeveloped areas or islands by crowdsourcing computing and network resources.
- openness: openness create transparency and trust. The trust reduces the transaction cost of map ecosystem and thus helps grow the surrounding ecosystems of urban computings. For example, the open model encourages data-sharing on the network among different spatial data stake-holders.  
- efficiency: More spatial data intensive applications will benefit from Map3, e.g. AR/VR/HD Map and etc. Low cost infrastructural services largely reduce the cost of try-and-error.

# briefly describe the project's leadership team and decision-making process
The project is led by a steering council of major contributors. Decisions are made by over 2/3 voting of the committee. Please refer to the governance document for details of council memberships.

# existing financial sponsorship
Now the developers are primarily sponsored by the Hyperion Lab. We hope to attract more open source developers or hire some full-time engineers if possible with donation. 

# infrastructure needs or requests 
- The open source project itself (tech architecture, code, media, culture, developers) 
- Growth the ecosystem (nodes, map uses, map layers)
- Together to broadcast to existing OSM and open map tech communities.
